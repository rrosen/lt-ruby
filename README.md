##Ruby for Light Table

This plugin is an alpha implementation of a ruby instarepl for the [Light Table](http://www.lighttable.com) IDE.  It can evaluate the contents of a ruby file and print the result of the last statement up at the top line.  It can also eval selections of ruby code and print the result next to it.

No extra editing of the file is needed, and the result comes back in the nice Light Table widgets.  Like a true repl eval happens in its own binding so your state will persist across evals.

## Installation

1.  From LightTable's plugin manager, choose the available tab and double-click the "Ruby Instarepl" plugin to install it.
2.  If your preferred ruby is not your system default, go to User Behaviors and add an entry for `(:lt.objs.langs.ruby/ruby-exe /path/to/ruby)`
3.  Open the Command Bar and choose `App: Reload Behaviors` or restart LightTable
4.  Open up a ruby file, select some code and use `ctrl/cmd-enter` to eval it.  Use `ctrl/cmd-shift-enter` to eval the whole file (the result will be added off the first line).

## Requirements

You'll need the `eventmachine` and `json` gems installed.  RVM users should set the path to their preferred ruby executable in `:lt.objs.langs.ruby/ruby-exe`

Developed on Mac OS X 10.7 with ruby 2.0.  I have no clue if it works on other platforms.

## The Road Forward
There are some rough edges still to clean up.  The evaluation environment could be better sandboxed, for instance.

Once I get things working better for vanilla ruby, I plan to add better support for RVM and Rails.

It could also be nice to incorporate the advanced features from the stock LT plugins, such as results for individual statements within a block of eval'd code and watches.

## Acknowledgements

The clojurescript / lighttable side are pretty much simple searches and replaces of the equivalent files from the Python plugin.  Thank you Chris and everyone else at Kodowa for getting me so inspired about a text editor.

## Changelog

##### 0.0.2

Numerous bugfixes and general less-janky-making.  You no longer to need to manually create the connection (just select some code and eval).
